notes:
Descriptions savable, when you hit 'OK' it will save it to export_ancillaries.txt. 
'Undo changes' does not undo these changes! 
If the descriptions do not exist they will be created when you save.

--Trigger Editing--
The 'full text' box is there for your convience. You can enter or paste text into the edit box
as if it were notepad. In order for the text you enter to be recongised you must press 'parse text'.
Be aware that the game is case-sensitive and if you do not enter a correct condition you will get errors! 
Really you should ignore the 'full text' unless for some reason you cannot enter in the data you wish to
