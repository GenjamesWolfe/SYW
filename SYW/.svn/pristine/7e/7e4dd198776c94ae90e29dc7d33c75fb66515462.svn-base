FileParser v1.0 (03:04 AM|20/11/2005)








Altough this is not the most useful tool you've
 ever seen this might be the ultimate tool for 
creating pak files (for Xpak of course).

The install also includes Vercingetorix's Xpak, wich
 was made for, and the batch file wich unpaks everything.

It allows to easily select the files you want
 to pak and create the new txt and batch 
automatically the only thing left for you to do is to 
run the batch file from the dir you stored FileParser.

The tool also generates a batch for testing 
the pak (unpaks the created pak to check everything 
in case problems occur or you forgotten to add something).

More details I also added within it's help including
troubleshooting and contact.

All the thanks go to Vercingetorix.
